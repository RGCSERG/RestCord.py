Problem Identification:
Discord is a social media platform popular among millions of users worldwide, serving various purposes including content sharing, software development, and online communities. 
Despite being popular, Discord's API, for inexperienced programmers, can be brutal to work with directly, in particular for complex web applications. 
Developing a wrapper around the API can simplify and streamline the development process for developers regardless of skill level or experience, by offering offers a cleaner and more user-friendly way to interact with the API.
At the current time of creating this project, there are only 2 or 3 API wrappers such as Discord.py and Hikari and Zenora.
Although the use of Discord.py and Hikari can be annoying for web-based applications mainly due to their asynchronous nature and the utilisation of the asyncio library. 
From personal experience, this can result in difficulties integrating it with other frameworks, such as Flask which was originally designed for synchronous request/response processing.
Additionally, both libaries are designed specifically for Discord bots, which makes a wrapper purpose-built for web applications even more important.
Resuto hopes to help developers by providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for accessing the REST API without the need for async/await (useful for bots dealing with multiple requests from users simultaneously).
This will make it particularly useful for designing bot web dashboards and other non-async applications.
It will also support OAuth features, simplifying the procedue of implementing authentication in applications.
